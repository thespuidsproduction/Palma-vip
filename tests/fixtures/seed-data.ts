/**
 * The PALMA seed cast.
 *
 * Nine people, and every one of them declares here what they are: an operator,
 * a judge, a creator, or more than one of those. There is no second list of
 * names anywhere — the accounts, the panel, the archive and the claim states
 * are all derived from this array, so the cast cannot drift out of step with
 * itself the way three parallel lists would.
 *
 * Read by `prisma/seed.ts` and by nothing else. It is not part of the
 * application: PostgreSQL is the single source of truth, and a name appears on
 * the site because it is in the database, never because it is in this file.
 *
 * Deliberately small. A demonstration dataset is easier to trust when a person
 * can hold all of it in their head — and a thin archive is an honest picture of
 * a young institution rather than a fake picture of a busy one.

    body: `Regular sexual health screening is part of working in this industry, in the same way that a pension and an accountant are. It is maintenance rather than a response to something going wrong, and the creators who treat it that way spend far less time worrying about it.

PALMA is not a clinic and will not tell you how often to test. That is a conversation with a sexual health service, and the honest answer depends on what you do, who with, and how often. What PALMA will say is that the decision belongs with a qualified clinician rather than with a forum, a producer, or a platform.

Most sexual health services in the UK are free, confidential and open to anyone regardless of immigration status or registration with a GP. Many offer postal testing kits, which for a self-employed person is usually the difference between a test happening and a test being postponed indefinitely. Confidentiality is the default: a service does not tell your GP, your family or anyone you work with unless you ask it to.

Three practical notes from people who have been doing this a long time.

Book the next one while you are still at the current one. The gap between intending to test and testing is where the risk actually lives, and a calendar entry closes it.

Keep your own records. Not for anyone else to inspect, but because a date you can check is worth more than a date you half remember, and because some collaborations will ask and you want to answer from a note rather than from memory.

Ask about vaccination. Several relevant vaccines are offered free to people in higher-risk groups, and a service can tell you in one appointment what you are eligible for.

If something is worrying you now, do not wait for a routine appointment. Sexual health services will see people urgently, and the thing you are worried about is almost always more treatable than the version of it in your head at three in the morning.`,

    body: `The creators who have the fewest bad days are the ones who write things down. Not a contract drafted by a solicitor, though that matters for money. A list, in writing, agreed before anyone arrives: what is happening, what is not happening, who is present, how long, and what the word is that stops it.

This is not a formality and it is not distrust. It is the difference between a disagreement about what was agreed and a disagreement about whether something was agreed at all, and only one of those is survivable.

Four things worth having in writing every time.

What the work is. Specific enough that nobody arrives with a different film in their head.

What it is not. The list of things that are not happening is the more useful list, and it should be written by whoever has the most to lose by it being vague.

How it stops. An agreed word or gesture that ends the take immediately, with no negotiation afterwards about whether it was meant. Anyone present can use it.

Where it goes. Which platforms, which territories, how long, and whether it can be resold. A creator who has not agreed distribution has agreed nothing.

Agreement given before the day can be withdrawn on the day, and withdrawal is not a breach of anything. Someone who treats a prior message as a commitment that overrides what a person says in the room has misunderstood the document and probably the law.

Keep the thread. Not as ammunition, but because memory is unreliable and a dated message is not. PALMA's own enforcement process asks for evidence, and the people who can produce it are consistently the people who kept the boring paperwork.`,

    body: `Self-employment removes the two things that used to enforce rest: a closing time and a colleague who notices. What replaces them has to be deliberate, because nothing about this work will stop you on its own.

The pattern PALMA sees repeatedly is not dramatic. It is a creator who has not had a full day off in five months, whose output is still good, and who is quietly certain that stopping would cost them everything. They are usually wrong about the second part, and by the time the work does drop off it takes far longer to recover than the break would have taken.

Some things that help, from people who have come out the other side.

Put days off in the calendar before you fill it. A day that is already booked is much harder to give away than a day that is merely empty.

Separate the accounts from the work. Doing your invoices at midnight after shooting is how a bad month starts to feel like a bad career. They are different jobs and they deserve different hours.

Have somebody outside the industry you talk to properly. Not for advice about the work, but so that your entire sense of how you are doing does not come from an audience.

Notice the early signs rather than the late ones: sleep going first, then appetite, then the thing you used to enjoy about the work feeling like admin.

If it has gone further than tiredness, that is a health matter and not a character flaw. A GP is a reasonable first call and so is any of the free listening services that operate around the clock. This industry has a higher-than-average share of people carrying things alone, and almost none of them needed to be.`,

PALMA was built the other way round. The Roll of Honour existed before the first ceremony did, because the record is the product and the evening is an expression of it. Every honour carries a signed verification record that anyone can check, without an account and without asking us.

That has a consequence we accept: an honour conferred today has to still be defensible in ten years. It is why the panel is published, why the criteria are published before nominations open, and why a revoked honour stays on the record marked revoked rather than vanishing.

An archive you can quietly edit is not an archive. It is a marketing page with a date on it.`,

The rule permitting that is published: where a category receives too few eligible candidacies to judge credibly, PALMA may decline to confer an honour, and will say so publicly rather than lower the standard.

It is an uncomfortable thing to do in a first season, when the institution has every incentive to look busy. It is also the single clearest signal we could send about what the other honours mean. A PALMA that is conferred every year regardless is a participation medal with better typography.

What they are shown is a prepared case: the eligibility checks PALMA has already completed, a sample of what the audience said, the evidence our team gathered, and the category's own criteria.

A judge cannot reach the scale without declaring whether they have a conflict, and declaring removes the candidate from their assignments immediately. The chair decides whether it mattered, not the judge.

Where four or more judges have scored a candidacy, the highest and lowest scores are dropped before ranking. Panels disagree, and one outlier, enthusiastic or hostile, should not decide a PALMA.

A submitted assessment cannot be edited. If PALMA needs a correction it goes through an administrator, and the state before and after is written to the audit log.`,
