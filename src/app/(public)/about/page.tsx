                PALMA exists because the adult creator industry has been poorly served by
                recognition. The awards it has tended to be offered measure audience, which is a
                measure of distribution, not of work, and expire the moment the post scrolls past.
              </p>
              <p>
                PALMA is built the other way round. The archive came before the ceremony. Every
                honour is entered into the PALMA Roll of Honour, carries a permanent verification
                record, and is judged against published criteria by a panel that is told, in
                writing, to discount how many people are watching.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are deliberately narrow. PALMA is not a platform, a marketplace, a subscription
                service or a social network. It hosts no creator work and brokers no services. Its
                only authority is the care with which it keeps the record, so that is the thing we
                protect.

                  The palm has stood for victory and honour for a very long time. PALMA takes the
                  idea, not the imagery: an engraved mark, a seal, a record.
